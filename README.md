# FlxTactics Engine
  
A small project that is ultimately going to serve as a base for several other tactics games. ATM I'm trying to just get a basic engine going with all the fixings. The goal of this is that it's extendable in several hundred directions. Wanna add buildings? Wanna add new mechanics? Wanna make an entirely different genre of game (like Roguelike?) This engine should allow that.

The three principles of this engine are
- State based, the visuals are written from the state and the state is sometimes written from the visuals (in some animation cases,) but ultimately the state is the source of ultimate truth
- (Mostly) platform agnostic. This is running with Flixel but ultimately if you wanted to seperate it, it shouldn't be too hard.
- Freeform. This BASE engine should not force a certain kind of game.

Knock yourself out poking around, I'm always looking for collaborators~
